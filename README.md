## Project Description
In 2016, ProPublica published an analysis of the Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS) tool. COMPAS is a proprietary tool which generates a so-called risk assessment for defendants in a criminal trial. ProPublica's analysis focused on the "recidivism score," which purports to provide the likelihood of recidivism (i.e. committing a misdemeanor of felony) within two years of assessment.
