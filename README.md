# Data_Fairness_Project

## Project Description
In 2016, ProPublica published an analysis of the Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS) tool. COMPAS is a proprietary tool which generates a so-called risk assessment for defendants in a criminal trial. ProPublica's analysis focused on the "recidivism score," which purports to provide the likelihood of recidivism (i.e. committing a misdemeanor of felony) within two years of assessment.

## Project Outline
1. Import the data, implement a few pre-processing steps, and inspect the data
2. Run a short exploratory analysis of the COMPAS recidivism score, our primary variable of interest
3. Reproduce the logistic regression model in ProPublica's analysis and interpret the estimates
4. Compute the predictive accuracy of the risk score labels
